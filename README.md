Project Title: Password Strength Checker
Author: EclipseManic

## Description:
This Python script checks the strength of a password based on predefined criteria. It evaluates the password against multiple rules and provides feedback on its security level, along with tips for improvement.

Minimum length of 8 characters

At least one uppercase letter

At least one lowercase letter

At least one numeric digit

# Provides visual feedback (‚úÖ/‚ùå) for each criterion.

Assigns a strength score:

Strong (5/5 criteria met)

Good (3-4 criteria met)

Weak (<3 criteria met)

Emoji-enhanced output for clarity.

## Requirements:

Python 3.x

Terminal/console that supports emojis (for proper display)

## Installation:
